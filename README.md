# calendarize
a front-end calendar plugin that can remember events in the current session

This was my first js project. you can place this calendar and its js at the corner of your webapp and you can expect people to use it!
The comments basically describe how it owrks. Note: you will have to save the data into a database for cross-session usages.

Enjoy!
